Hi, I'm Timothy, and currently working as a full stack web developer. I studied Math and computer science in college and have an interest in algorithms and computability. Mostly, you'll find practice problems or personal project I'm working on here. I'm always interestd in learning new things, and working on new problems. I mainly work in C++ and C#, though you might see some python for machine learning/data science projects if I get around to publishing them here.
